# Ergodox EZ keymap

This is the keymap for the [Ergodox EZ][ez] that I use. It is supposed to represent a German keyboard layout, but it is tailored to my needs. As of now, only the first two layers are documented.

Base Layer:

Symbol Layer:
![german-aticu-layer1](layer1.png)

Mouse/Game Layer:
![german-aticu-layer1](layer2.png)

Special keys:
* The Copy/Paste key sends the copy command when held and sends the paste command when released.
* The key next to it closes the currently open window (Alt+F4).
* The Undo/Redo key undoes the last action when pressed and redoes it when held.
* The -> key sends "->" as a string on a German keyboard.
* The => key sends "=>" as a string on a German keyboard.
