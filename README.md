# Ergodox EZ keymap

This is the keymap for the [Ergodox EZ][ez] that I use.
It is based on a German keyboard layout, but it is tailored to my needs.

To access the gimp layer, press "Lead" and then "G"

Special keys:

* The Copy/Paste key sends the copy command when held and sends the paste command when released.
* The key next to it closes the currently open window (Alt+F4).
* The Undo/Redo key undoes the last action when pressed and redoes it when held.
* The -> key sends "->" as a string on a German keyboard layout.
* The => key sends "=>" as a string on a German keyboard layout.
* The // key sends "//" as a string on a German keyboard layout.
* The /// key sends "///" as a string on a German keyboard layout.
* The \`\`\` key sends "\`\`\`" as a string on a German keyboard layout.
* The \` key sends "\`" directly on a German keyboard layout (it isn't a dead key).
* The ^ key sends "^" directly on a German keyboard layout (it isn't a dead key).
